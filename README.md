# UnifiedEnergyInterface
A project to work on the DISCOM outputs across India and to rate their UEI index ( a personal index inspired by the UEI framework by FIDE where I'm scoring the index on the parameters of the discoms like openness, demand visibility and load issues) this is just the beginning of UEI.
